## How to use Git

Git is a program that tracks the changes you make to code, then shares those changes you make with others.  A collection of code in one folder is called a "repository" (repo for short).  Groups of changes are put together to make a "commit".  You can view a history of all the commits made using `git log`.

**Editing locally**   

  1. Edit the code you want to edit, save it, test it, fix it, save it
  2. go to terminal, cd to the the folder with our code, then run `git status` to see what you changed, alternatively, use one of the many git GUIs available  
  3. Make a commit of all your changes by running `git commit -a -m "i did this, this, and this"`  whats in the quotes is a short messages describing changes you made so others can see  
   
**Sharing your edits**  
  
  After you've made all the commits you want, push them to the Github.com  
  
  1. `git remote update` to make sure your local code is up to date  
  2. `git pull` to update your code if it isnt up to date  
  3. `git push origin master` to push your code
